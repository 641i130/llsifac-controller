# LUNAR Vanguard's Custom LLSIFAC controller

## Purpose
This document is to help anyone who uses these design files to make a functional controller for playing LLSIFAC on either the PS4 or PC.
The designs as is do have a number of issues that should be noted before trying to build what is presented wholesale. If there is enough desire I will update the designs with fixes

## Tools needed for manufactureing
* 3d printer, bigger print space the better
* laser cutter or mill

## useful links
* <https://www.ponoko.com/> Offers laser cutting of materials. 
* <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSNXLN0> Correct sized cheap buttons for playing.

## Current known issues
* Metal insert or a metal rod was not used to screw into for the panel and bottom mounting screw. The screws often rip out the 3d print and strip it.
* The design should copy how the top of the frame is designed to allow more space for wires
* The holes on the bottom panel for the vesa mount is about 2 inches to low to make the screen align well with the buttons
